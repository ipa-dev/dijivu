Requires at least: 3.9

Stable tag: 3.5.1

Interface to customize the permalinks (author, category, archives and pagination) and htaccess file generated by WordPress.

== Description ==

**WP htaccess Control** should now really be called WP htaccess *and Rewrite* Control. It provides an interface to customize the htaccess file generated by WordPress but also its permalinks (author, category, archives, pagination and custom taxonomies). Have a look at the screenshot for a clearer idea of the available options.

**Features:**

* Customizing the htaccess file generated by WordPress;
* Removing any custom taxonomy's slug base from permalinks;
* Removing the category base from permalinks;
* Removing the author base from permalinks;
* Customizing the Author Permalink Base;
* Customizing Paginated Permalinks (translate the "page" word on permalinks to your own language);
* Customization (and canonization) of the Search Permalink Base;
* Creation of Category, Author, Tag and Custom Taxonomy based archives (ex: *"http://your-site.com/category/stories/2010/12"*, *"http://your-site.com/author/admin/2010/12/page/2"* and *"http://your-site.com/tag/wordpress/2010/12"*), this will also work if you've removed the base slug;
* Maintenance mode.

**Easy to use "Suggested htaccess" rules:**

* Jim Morgan's htaccess;
* Disable directory browsing;
* Disable and redirect image hotlinking;
* Disable and redirect file hotlinking;
* Force canonical url (WWW or non-WWW);
* Limit maximum file upload size;
* Protect wp-config.php file from access;
* Protect .htaccess file from access;
* Protect comments.php from spam bots coming from nowhere;
* Set 500 error page;
* Set 403 error page;
* Use mod_gzip if available;
* Use mod_deflate if available;
* Set admin email on server generated error pages;
* Disable ServerSignature on server generated error pages.

**POT file is included, translations are welcome.**

== Installation ==

1. Download **WP htaccess Control**;
2. Extract its content;
3. Upload the **wp-htaccess-control** folder to **wp-content/plugins**;
4. Activate it under **Plugins**;
5. Configurate it under **Settings** > **WP htaControl**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Pagination base is not working on Twenty Fourteen or some other theme? =
WP htaccess Control can modify the pagination permalink structure for you (ie, turn "/page/2" into "/pagina/2") and will also try to intercept any method outputting pagination links so the structure change is seamless.

Some themes however do not use the standard way of generating these pagination links, which means WP htaccess Control can't update them.

Unfortunately this is the case for Twenty Fourteen. To make it clear, this is a markup issue; if you type in the new structure in the address bar it will still work as expected.


= Do you have any questions? = 
Suggestions are welcome and please report any bugs found!

== Screenshots ==

1. Administration page (as of v.2.0)

== Known Issues ==

I still haven't tested this under **WordPress multisite**, issues have however been reported.

== Additional Credit ==

Removal of the category base is based on iDope's **WP No Category Base** but extended so that it works with category archives (ie.: *"http://example.com/my-category/2010/12"*).

Search redirection is based on Mark Jaquith's **Nice Search** but extended so that it works with custom search base (ie.: *"http://example.com/search-base/search-term"*).

== Stable Versions ==

For WordPress versions above 3.9 use the plugin version 3.4.

For WordPress versions above 3.4 use the plugin version 3.3.

For WordPress versions prior to 3.4 use the plugin version 2.7.2.1.
